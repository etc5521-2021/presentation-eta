# Analysis

- **Local Government Area** names are abbreviated in the Local Government Area structure  

- One LGA has multiple postcodes. (POAs = Postal Areas)

- For instance, Hume LGA has 21 postcodes in it. 

- Darker colors refer to higher number of cases confirmed, lighter refers to lower

- Some lighter colors are found surrounded by darker colors and those areas with lighter colors are not residential areas, examples are:   
1.Postcode: 3045, LGA: Hume is Melbourne International Airport   
   
**For further details, please refer to the the markers on the map**

# Analysis

-   **Casey** has the highest population, however the cases don't keep up. Possible Causes: Spaced out residential area, non essential activity down by 27%
-   **Wyndham/Brimbank** - culturally diverse blue-collar local government area. Very large families, lower socio-economic conditions, people who actually work in the factories, who do logistics, who deal with warehousing, who run small businesses and keep things running
-   Warnings were not taken seriously until it was too late
-   Multicultural communities in **Hume**, many new arrivals, and English proficiency is below the city average
-   **Boroondora** and **Whitehorse** have more affluent communities and that reflects in their numbers.

.panel[.panel-name[Overview]


- Local Government Area **Melton** is present in all types of spread. 

- **Brimbank** and **Hume** are high in places in where it was contracted locally.

- With **Melbourne** and **Whittlesea** are also high in numbers but still relatively lower.
